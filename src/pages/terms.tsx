              We do not claim any ownership rights in any User Content and
              nothing in these Terms will be deemed to restrict any rights that
              you may have to use and exploit your User Content. Subject to the

            <p>
              <strong>Rights in User Content Granted by You</strong>
              By making any User Content available through the Service, you
              hereby grant to Snip a non-exclusive, transferable, worldwide,
              royalty-free license, with the right to sublicense, to use, host,
              cache, store, reproduce, transmit, publicly display, publicly
              perform, publish, distribute and modify (for formatting purposes
              only), your User Content solely in connection with operating and
              providing the Service and Content to you and, depending on the
              permission you grant, to other users. Subject to the foregoing
              license, as between Snip and you, you retain any and all of your
              rights to your User Content.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Your Responsibility for User Content</strong>
              You are solely responsible for all your User Content. You
              represent and warrant that you own all your User Content or you
              have all rights that are necessary to grant us the license rights
              in your User Content under these Terms. You also represent and
              warrant that neither your User Content, nor your use and provision
              of your User Content to be made available through the Service, nor
              any use of your User Content by Snip on or through the Service
              will infringe, misappropriate or violate a third party’s
              intellectual property rights, or rights of publicity or privacy,
              or result in the violation of any applicable law or regulation.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Sharing User Content</strong>
              You may designate your User Content as “public” (such as posting
              User Content as a Blog Post) or “private”. You agree that User
              Content you designate as public will be accessible by and be
              available to other users of the Service to whom you grant access
              to such publicly designated User Content. Consequently, you
              understand and agree that such users will have the right to view,
              comment on and tag your publicly designated User Content. If you
              grant users additional permissions with respect to your User
              Content, you understand and agree that such users will, depending
              on the permissions you grant, have the right to use, publish,
              display, modify, or duplicate such User Content. You grant Snip
              all rights necessary to make any of your publicly designated User
              Content available to other users of the Service and to permit
              those users to engage in the activities described in this Section
              with respect to your publicly designated User Content.

              You can remove your User Content that you designate as private by
              specifically deleting it. However, some of your User Content may
              not be completely removed and copies of your User Content may
              continue to exist on the Service. Additional details with respect
              to the removal and storage of User Content are set forth in
              Section 17 (Termination) below.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Rights in Content Granted by Snip</strong>
              Subject to your compliance with these Terms, Snip grants to you a
              limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license, with no right to
              sublicense, to download, view, copy, display and print the Content
              solely in connection with your permitted use of the Services and

              Although we’re not obligated to monitor access to or use of the
              Service or Content or to review or edit any Content, we have the
              right to do so for the purpose of operating the Service, to ensure
              compliance with these Terms and to comply with applicable law or
              other legal requirements. We reserve the right, but are not
              obligated, to remove or disable access to any Content, including
              User Content, at any time and without notice, including, but not
              limited to, if we, at our sole discretion, consider any Content to
              be objectionable or in violation of these Terms. We have the right
              to investigate violations of these Terms or conduct that affects
              the Services. We may also consult and cooperate with law
              enforcement authorities to prosecute users who violate the law.
            </p>

            <h2>Free Trial</h2>

            <p>
              Snip may, at its sole discretion, offer a Subscription with a free
              trial for a limited period of time ("Free Trial"). If you are on a
              Free Trial, you may cancel at any time until the last day of your
              Free Trial by following the cancellation procedures outlined in
              the Subscription section of these Terms. If you or Snip cancel
              your Free Trial, you acknowledge and agree that we may delete all
              of your User Content or data associated with the Account that was
              assigned to your Free Trial. If you do not cancel your Free Trial,
              then your Free Trial will be converted to a paid Subscription at
              the end of the trial period, and you hereby authorize us to charge
              your credit card or other payment method for continued use of the
              paid Service under such Subscription. You may then however, cancel
              your Subscription in accordance with the Subscription section of
              these Terms.
            </p>

            <p>
              At any time and without notice, Snip reserves the right to (a)
              modify the terms and conditions of any Free Trial offer, (b)
              cancel any Free Trial offer, or (c) cancel any Free Trial
              subscription at any time.
            </p>

            <h2>Fees and Fee Changes</h2>

            <p>
              Snip, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the
              Subscription fees for the Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee
              change will become effective at the end of the then-current
              Billing Cycle.
            </p>

            <p>
              Snip will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change
              in Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your

            </p>

            <p>
              Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee
              change comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the
              modified Subscription fee amount.
            </p>

            <p>
              Fees are stated exclusive of any taxes or similar governmental
              assessments of any nature, including, for example, value-added,
              sales, use or withholding taxes, assessable by any jurisdiction
              (collectively, “Taxes”). You will be responsible for paying all
              Taxes associated with your Subscription, except for those taxes
              based on our net income. Should any payment for the Service be
              subject to withholding tax by any government, you will reimburse
              us for such withholding tax.
            </p>

            <h2>Refunds</h2>

            <p>
              Payment obligations are non-cancelable, and fees paid are
              non-refundable and there are no credits for partially used
              Subscription periods.
            </p>

            <p>
              Certain refund requests for Subscriptions may be considered by
              Snip on a case-by-case basis and granted in sole discretion of
              Snip.
            </p>
